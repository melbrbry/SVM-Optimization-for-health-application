# SVM-Optimization-for-health-application
In this project, we implement training methods for Support Vector Machines (supervised learning) applied to classification problems, namely for an health application

## Getting Started

You need to clone the reporistory to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal where you like to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/melbrbry/SVM-Optimization-for-health-application
```

### Prerequisites

Required packages (use pip install on linux):  
numpy
sklearn
scipy
pandas

## Repository Description
The repository has only one branch: the master branch.

## Documentation
In this section, I write a brief description of some of the repository files/folders

**main.py**: the main code, it runs all the three methods adopted for the solution with the optimal hyperparameters.

**function.py**: impelements the three methods adopted.

**output_homework2_28.txt**: a file where the results are saved.

**Report.pdf**: full project report
