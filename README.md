# SVM-Optimization-for-health-application
In this project, we implement training methods for Support Vector Machines (supervised learning) applied to classification problems, namely for an health application

## Getting Started

You need to clone the reporistory to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal where you like to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/melbrbry/SVM-Optimization-for-health-application
```

### Prerequisites

Required packages (use pip install on linux):  
numpy
sklearn
scipy
pandas

## Repository Description
The repository has only one branch: the master branch.

## Documentation
In this section, I write a brief description of some of the repository files/folders

**lstm.py**: build the LSTM network and do the training, validation and testing on the dataset.

**preprocessing.py**: preprocess the data, the output of MRCNN, and put it in a format ready to be fed to the LSTM.

**utilities.py**: some helpful functions that are used in lstm.py

**models**: the best performing model weights, plots and log files of the results.
